            <h2>Fully Stocked</h2>
            <p><i>Container vessels are a common sight in ports around the world, but this one is particularly well-stocked.</i></p>
            <p><i>They're a vital part of the global supply chain, but where is this one moored?</i></p>
            <p><i>In which city would you find this port?</i></p>

            <h3>Ship markings</h3>
            <p>I see the ship has the markings "UASC". When I search for UASC and shipping, I see the United Arab Shipping Company.</p>
            <p>The ship looks to be a UASC A15-Klasse or something similar.</p>
            <p>I can see on top of the ship that there are cranes marked with the letters "RDKAI".</p>
            <p>When I search for RDKAI cranes, an article from the <a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/roboter-kraene-und-ki-wie-asiens-hightech-haefen-zum-vorbild-fuer-hamburg-werden-sollen-110016468.html" target="_blank">Frankfurter Allgemeine</a> 
newspaper comes up with images of cranes saying TERMINAL BUCHARDKAI.</p>

              <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/Buchardkai.png" alt="Prague metro train" class="small-image">
            </div>
            
            <p>It's hard to see whether the terminal is the same as the one in my picture, so I'll look on Google Maps.
            <p>When I search for Terminal Buchardkai on Google Maps, a port at Hamburg comes up.</p>

              <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/buchardmap.png" alt="Prague metro train" class="small-image">
            </div>
            
            <p>I want to confirm this with more information, so I'll keep searching.</p>

            <h3>Port landscape details</h3>
            <p>The bridge in the background looks unusual, with the line of cranes in front of it.</p>
            <p>When I search for this image using Google Image Search, a picture of the Hamburg port comes up with an article titled <a href="https://www.porttechnology.org/news/hamburg-kick-starts-elbe-expansion/" target="_blank">Hamburg Kick-Starts Elbe Expansion</a>.</p>

              <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/Hamburg-dredging.jpg" alt="Prague metro train" class="small-image">
            </div>
            
            <p>Zooming in on the image shows the bridge in the background.</p>
            <p>I can also see the red cranes in the Hamburg port picture.</p>
            <p>This confirms the earlier information.</p>
            <p>There is probably a lot more searching I could do in more detail to confirm this further, but I don't think it's necessary.</p>
