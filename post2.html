    <h2>Challenge 1: What a Dump!</h2>

    <p><i>Sometimes the most interesting things are found in the most unexpected places...</i></p>
    <p><i>... but sometimes those places are full of trash.</i></p>
    <p><i>This dumpster is in an alley somewhere, but where?</i></p>
    <p><i>Where was the photographer standing when they took this photo?</i></p>
    <p><i>Use latitude and longitude in decimal format with three decimals (12.345, -67.890).</i></p>
        
    
           


    <h3>Looking for language information</h3>
    <p>In this image I can see a label on the dumpster in English saying "Do Not Park".</p>
           <p>I can also see a label saying 8yd, meaning 8yd. Yards are a common measurement in the US, but not anywhere else.</p>
           <p>I think this dumpster must be in the United States. </p>

           <h3>Companies</h3>
           <p>On the dumpster there is a sign from what appears to be a waste management company.</p>
           <p>The phone number starts with 800.</p>

           <h3>Graffiti</h3>
           <p>The dumpster has written on it "Howard U" in faint text.</p>
           <p>Howard University is in Washington D.C.</p>
           <p>When I search for "waste management 800 Washington DC", the waste management company's logo comes up.</p>
           <p>The dumpster is probably in Washington D.C. near Howard University.</p>
           
           <h3>Image Search</h3>
           <p>When I searched for the image on Google Image Search, a lot of similar images come up but most don't match.</p>
           <p>One unique feature of the image is that it has this weird bridge over the alleway.</p>
           <p>It also has an unusual red brick and white brick pattern on the left side.</p>
           <p>One of the images that came up was this picture from Christopher Rabadi on Facebook.</p>

<img src="images/RibaldiPhoto.png" alt="Christopher Ribaldi Image" class="small-image">

           <p>It has the same bridge in it, as well as the same red and white brick pattern on the left side.</p>
           <p>He lists this alleyway as being at Union Market.</p>

           
<img src="images/UnionMarket.png" alt="Union Market tag" class="small-image">

           <p>When I search for Union Market in Washington D.C., I find an area near Howard University.</p>
           <p>This area has a small alleyway called Morse Street Alley.
           <p>I used Google Street View to go down the alleyway on the map, it looks similar but the bridge is missing.</p>
           <p>I found the red and white brick pattern on one of the buildings, and aligned the image so that the metal garage door is on the right.</p>

 <img src="images/Wallpattern.png" alt="Shot of the alleyway" class="small-image">

           <p>I used the Google Maps url in Chrome to look at the coordinates.</p>

           <h3>The coordinates for the photo of the dumpster are 38.910, -67.890.</h3>
