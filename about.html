            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>This website is dedicated to tracking the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) challenges that I complete as part of the Bellingcat OSINT community.</p>
            <p>The challenges are designed to improve investigative skills using open-source information. Each challenge involves real-world scenarios, where OSINT techniques are applied to gather, analyze, and verify information from publicly available sources.</p>
            <p>This project serves as both a personal log of my progress and a showcase of the skills and methods Iâ€™ve learned through completing these challenges. It also provides a reference for others who want to get involved in OSINT investigations.</p>
            <h3>Why OSINT?</h3>
            <p>OSINT is a powerful tool for gathering intelligence, solving mysteries, and uncovering hidden details from publicly available data. It involves using everything from social media to satellite images to understand a situation or piece of information in more depth. The challenges are designed to improve these skills in real-life contexts.</p>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm passionate about investigative work and constantly learning new ways to improve my OSINT techniques. This website is a reflection of that journey, and I hope it inspires others to dive into the world of OSINT as well.</p>
