    <h2>Challenge 4: Foul Play</h2>

    <p><i>This is what it looks like to be on the receiving end of a foul ball at a baseball game.</i></p>
    <p><i>Be careful out there! But who is responsible for this hit?</i></p>
    <p><i>What is the name of the batter?</i></p>
    
    <p>This Bellingcat challenge shows a video clip of a batter hitting a ball in a baseball game. You can see the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THeJFjKhb9Y&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fchallenge.bellingcat.com%2F" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Uniform search</h3>
    <p>One of the best ways to identify a player in a game is to analyze their uniform.</p>
    <p>Look for team logos, numbers, and other distinguishing features that can help identify the batter.</p>

    <h3>Stadium details</h3>

    <h3>Stadium signs</h3>
    <p>On the top right, the ticker is displaying number 31 and a name which looks like it starts with D.</p>

    <h3>Baseball websites</h3>
    <p>When I search for baseballers who wear the number 31 in the year 2022, 2023 or 2024, a few players wear the number 31 and start with D.</p>
    <p>The name "DeLoach" looks like it could fit.</p>
    <p>When I Google 31 Deloach, I find that he plays for the Chicago White Sox.</p>
    <p>I look up Blue Jays vs White Sox at the Rogers Centre, and find an image with uniforms that appear to match the uniforms in the video.</p>

    <h3>The name of the batter who hit the foul ball is Zach DeLoach.</h3>
