    <h2>Challenge 4: Foul Play</h2>

    <p><i>This is what it looks like to be on the receiving end of a foul ball at a baseball game.</i></p>
    <p><i>Be careful out there! But who is responsible for this hit?</i></p>
    <p><i>What is the name of the batter?</i></p>
    
    <p>This Bellingcat challenge shows a video clip of a batter hitting a ball in a baseball game. You can see the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THeJFjKhb9Y&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fchallenge.bellingcat.com%2F" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Uniform search</h3>
    <p>One of the best ways to identify a player in a game is to analyze their uniform.</p>
    <p>I can see the names "Bichette" and part of what appears to be "Guerrero Jr.", both of whom play for the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>
    <p>From a quick Google search, the powder blue uniform also clearly belongs to the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>

    <p>But the Blue Jays aren't the batting team, they're the fielding team. The batting team wears black and white.</p>
    <p>Searching for away team baseball uniforms comes up with too many results that are black and white, to narrow it down.</p>

    <h3>Stadium details</h3>
    <p>The stadium has the word "Rogers" on it, as well as the "Corona Rooftop Patio", both of which seem to relate to the Rogers Centre.</p>
    <p>There is also a sign talking about the "official hot dogs of the Toronto Blue Jays".</p>

     <img src="images/Wallpattern.png" alt="Shot of the alleyway" class="small-image">

    <p>It seems clear that this is a Toronto Blue Jays home game.</p>
    <p>There are far too many games played here for this to narrow it down.</p>

    <h3>Stadium signs</h3>
    <p>On the top right, the ticker is displaying number 31 and a name which looks like it starts with D.</p>
    <p>This ticker is displaying the name of the batter, but it's quite hard to read.</p>

    <h3>Baseball websites</h3>
    <p>When I search for baseballers who wear the number 31 in the year 2022, 2023 or 2024, a few players wear the number 31 and start with D.</p>
    <p>The name "DeLoach" looks like it could fit.</p>
    <p>When I Google 31 Deloach, I find that he plays for the Chicago White Sox.</p>

    <img src="images/Wallpattern.png" alt="Shot of the alleyway" class="small-image">

    
    <p>I look up Blue Jays vs White Sox at the Rogers Centre, and find an image with uniforms that appear to match the uniforms in the video.</p>
    <p>In the Blue Jays vs White Sox game, the Blue Jays wore powder blue and the White Sox wore black and white.</p>

    <h3>The name of the batter who hit the foul ball is Zach DeLoach.</h3>
