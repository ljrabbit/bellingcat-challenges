            <p><i>A car’s moving quickly along a highway, luckily there are some visible structures in the rear-view mirror and on the road-side to help you with your geolocation.</i></p>

            <h3>Looking for language information</h3>

            <h3>Political information</h3>
            <p>A specific political sign references a local election, which could provide a clue about the region or country this highway is located in.</p>

            <h3>License plate information</h3>

            <h3>Highway features</h3>
