            <h2>Challenge 3: Highway to the Unknown</h2>
            <p><i>A carâ€™s moving quickly along a highway, luckily there are some visible structures in the rear-view mirror and on the road-side to help you with your geolocation.</i></p>
            <p><i>The prominent building bears the name of a person, what is that name?</i></p>

            <h3>Looking for language information</h3>
            <p>I can see text in English on the rearview mirror saying objects in the mirror are closer than they appear.</p>
            <p>I can't see any street signs, and the numberplate on the car is too blurry to get any information from.</p>

            <h3>Plants and landscape</h3>
            <p>In the background I can see palm trees and other trees. This looks like a hot weather location.</p>

            <h3>Highway information</h3>
            <p>There is no barrier in the middle of the road, and I don't see any street markings.</p>
            <p>The car is driving with some kind of dangerously secured barrel on the roof.</p>
            <p>I can see the reflection of a bridge in the rearview mirror, behind the car.</p>
            <p>To me these factors indicate a developing country. It is probably one that speaks English.</p>

            <img src="images/palmdistribution.png" alt="Palm tree distribution" class="small-image">

            <p>When I look at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23147-2/figures/1" target="_blank">countries in which palm trees are distributed</a>, most of the English-speaking countries are not developing countries.</p>
            <p>However, Nigeria, on the west coast of Africa, is one of the largest English-speaking countries in the world.</p>
            <p>Nigeria also has a heavy distribution of palm trees.</p>


            <h3>Image search</h3>
            <p>I zoomed in on the building in the background and searched on Google Images.</p>
            <p>One of the images from Wikimedia Commons is the <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Daughter_of_Abraham_foundation_building_jabi_Abuja.jpg" target="_blank">Daughter of Abraham foundation building</a>, in Nigeria.</p>

            <h3>Text search</h3>
            <p>When I search for the building, and the words I can make out from the text, which looks to be "Useni Hall", I get a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=302179065827295&id=100081056107066&set=a.189969390381597&locale=ru_RU" target="_blank">Facebook event</a> result for "Julie Useni Hall".</p>

            <h3>Google street view</h3>
            <p>When I search for the Daughters of Abraham Foundation on Google Street view, I can see the matching building.</p>
            <p>In the background when I turn my view around, I can see the bridge over the highway.</p>
            <p>The road has been improved, but I feel pretty certain it's the right place.</p></p>


            <h3>The name of the person on the building is "Julie Useni".</h3>
