            <h2>Challenge 5: On the Metro</h2>
            <p><i>Watching the metro go past.</i></p>
            <p><i>Where is the photographer, what is the line, and where is the train heading?</i></p>
            <p><i>What is the destination station for this train?</i></p>

            <h3>Train colouring</h3>
            <p>Looking at the colours of the train, red and white, I can probably narrow down what type of train it is, and what country it is in. For example, Deutsche Bahn ICE trains are red and white. But the ICE train only has a red stripe at the bottom, not at the top as well.</p>

            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/ICEtrain.jpg" alt="Deutsche Bahn ICE train" class="small-image">
            </div>

            <p>Other possible red and white trains with two red stripes include the Tokyo Metro 02 Series, the Shinbundang Line in Seoul, trains on the Wuxi Metro in China, possibly the Prague metro (although the red and white markings don't look right), or St. Petersburg Metro in Russia, among other options. </p>
            <p>I'll try to narrow it down with other information.</p>
            
            <h3>Station characteristics</h3>
            <p>The station looks well-maintained. There is no rubbish on the ground, and the concrete looks clean.</p>
            <p>There appears to be a reflection of what looks like a red car in the windows of the train. Could the station be above ground?</p>
            <p>The station has what appears to be a halogen lamp bar in the top right corner.</p>
            <p>I can see the tiles on the wall behind the train, which appear to be black and white or brown and white square tiles.</p>
            <p>There are grey marble floor tiles and a black and white tactile paving for the blind at the edge of the platform. Seoul metro stations have a yellow band, as do Chinese stations. The Japanese stations also look like they have yellow tacatile paving.</p>
            <p>Prague stations seem to have the most similar <a href="https://prague-now.com/public-transport/tram-and-metro-in-prague/" target="_blank">tactile paving</a>. The paving is also slightly set back from the platform edge.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Google image search</h3>
            <p>When I search on Google Image Search for related images, some similar long-exposure shots come up for the Prague metro.</p>
            <p>So far I feel like this might be a good place to keep looking. I can see from the ceiling of the train station that it is <i>not</i> one of the more popular, beautiful stations in Prague.</p>
            <p>Maybe I can look further out, towards the end of the lines, to stations that are perhaps more boring.</p>

            <h3>People</h3>
            <p>There is either a child, or a relatively short man with dark hair at the end of the platform.</p>
            <p>Other than that, I don't see anyone else. It's either very early in the morning, or late at night, or this is not a particularly popular station. Of course it's also possible that the photographer just didn't capture anyone else.</p>
            <p>When I search for a Prague station at the end of one of the lines, Černý Most, I find some <a href="https://mapa-metra.cz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Metro-%C4%8Cern%C3%BD-most-stanice-v%C5%AFz-ve-stanici-metra-Praha.jpg" target="_blank">similar ceiling tiles</a> in cream and black and white.</p>
