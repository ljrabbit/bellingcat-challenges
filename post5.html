            <p><i>Watching the metro go past.</i></p>
            <p><i>Where is the photographer, what is the line, and where is the train heading?</i></p>
            <p><i>What is the destination station for this train?</i></p>

            <h3>Train colouring</h3>
            <p>Looking at the colours of the train, red and white, I can probably narrow down what type of train it is, and what country it is in. For example, Deutsche Bahn ICE trains are red and white. But the ICE train only has a red stripe at the bottom, not at the top as well.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Other possible red and white trains with two red stripes include the Tokyo Metro 02 Series, the Shinbundang Line in Seoul, trains on the Wuxi Metro in China, possibly the Prague metro, or St. Petersburg Metro in Russia, among other options. </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>I'll try to narrow it down with other information.</p>
            
            <h3>Station characteristics</h3>
            <p>The station looks well-maintained. There is no rubbish on the ground, and the concrete looks clean.</p>
            <p>There appears to be a reflection of what looks like a red car in the windows of the train. It also looks like there is natural light. Could the station be above ground?</p>
            <p>The station has what appears to be a halogen lamp bar running along the length of the platform.</p>
            <p>I can see the tiles on the wall behind the train, which appear to be black and white or brown and white square tiles.</p>
            <p>There are grey marble floor tiles and a black and white tactile paving for the blind at the edge of the platform. Seoul metro stations have a yellow band, as do Chinese stations. The Japanese stations also look like they have yellow tacatile paving.</p>
            <p>Prague stations seem to have the most similar <a href="https://prague-now.com/public-transport/tram-and-metro-in-prague/" target="_blank">tactile paving</a>. The paving is also slightly set back from the platform edge.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Google image search</h3>
            <p>When I search on Google Image Search for related images, some similar long-exposure shots come up for the Prague metro.</p>
            <p>So far I feel like this might be a good place to keep looking. I can see from the ceiling of the train station that it is <i>not</i> one of the more popular, beautiful stations in Prague.</p>
            <p>Maybe I can look further out, towards the end of the lines, to stations that are perhaps more boring.</p>

            <h3>People</h3>
            <p>There is either a child, or a relatively short man with dark hair at the end of the platform.</p>
            <p>Other than that, I don't see anyone else. It's either very early in the morning, or late at night, or this is not a particularly popular station. Of course it's also possible that the photographer just didn't capture anyone else.</p>
            <p>When I search for a Prague station at the end of one of the lines, Černý Most, I find some <a href="https://mapa-metra.cz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Metro-%C4%8Cern%C3%BD-most-stanice-v%C5%AFz-ve-stanici-metra-Praha.jpg" target="_blank">similar ceiling tiles</a> in cream and black and white.</p>

                <img src="images/cerny.jpg" alt="Prague metro tiles cerny" class="small-image">
            </div>

            <p>I think this is probably a Prague train station, above ground, and not in the middle of town.</p>

            <h3>Wikipedia and Train Maps</h3>
            <p>I found this list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prague_Metro_stations" target="_blank">Prague train stations</a> with images.</p>
            <p>Some of the stations that look like possible candidates include Nové Butovice, which has similar tiles, Karlovo náměstí, the Roztyly station, and the Hurka station, which is above ground but I can't see the tiles.</p>
         
            <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/map-of-metro-xl.png" alt="Prague metro map" class="small-image">
            </div>
            
            <p>I can rule out some of these stations by looking at the end of the platform. In my picture, the end of the platform has a reddish wall.</p>
            <p>In stations e.g. Karlovo náměstí, although it has a reddish wall, I can see that the tunnel is round, whereas in my picture the tunnel is square.</p>

              <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/Karlovo.png" alt="Prague metro tiles cerny" class="small-image">
            </div>
            
            <p>I can also see for the Roztyly station that while the tunnel is square, the wall is yellowish, and the lights look different.</p>

             <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/Roztyly.png" alt="Prague metro tiles cerny" class="small-image">
            </div>
            
            <p>The Nové Butovice station looks very similar, with the same marble floor tiles as my station. But the wall tiles look too brown, rather than black.</p> 
            <p>I can see the tunnel is square. Maybe my station is on the same line, or nearby.</p>
 
            <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/1080px-Praha_Metro_Nove_Butovice.jpg" alt="Prague metro tiles cerny" class="small-image">
            </div>
            
            <p>This fits well with the Hurka station, which is only one stop after Nové Butovice, and is an above-ground station.</p>

           <h3>YouTube</h3> 
            <p>I found a video of a Hurka train station <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAa1mWGt_rU&ab_channel=MetroCheck" target="_blank">walk-through</a>.</p>
            <p>When going into the station, I can see black tiles and reddish walls - a similar colour scheme and style to the train station in my image.</p>

            <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/Hurka.png" alt="Prague metro tiles cerny" class="small-image">
            </div>

            <p>As the video continues, the person walks down onto the platform and I can see a clear shot of a matching image to my image at around the 2 minute mark.</p>
            <p>When I compare the shot of the end of the platform, with the platform in my image, they look the same.</p>
 
            <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/compare.png" alt="Prague metro tiles cerny" class="small-image">
            </div>

        
            <p>I feel confident that this station is the Hurka station, but the signs on the platform are unreadable for which direction the train is going.</p>

            <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/Hurkamatch.png" alt="Prague metro tiles cerny" class="small-image">
            </div>

            <p>When I watch further, I can see the train on the left side of the platform has one (blurry) word on it, while the other side has two blurry words.</p>
            <p>This is the C line, so the train with two words must be going in the direction of Černý Most. The train going the other direction is therefore going towards Zličín.</p>
            <p>When I improve the video quality (/facepalm) I can see the name of Zličín on the front of the train.</p>

             <!-- Small image wrapped in container -->
            <div class="post-image-container">
                <img src="images/trainz.png" alt="Prague metro tiles cerny" class="small-image">
            </div>

            <h3>The train is at the Hurka station in Prague, on the C line. The train's destination is Zličín.</h3>
