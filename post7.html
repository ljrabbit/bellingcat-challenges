            <h2>Challenge 7: A Sticky Situation</h2>
            <p><i>In August of 2022, Bellingcat's Foeke Postma found himself looking over this beautiful view, complete with a Bellingcat sticker!</i></p>
            <p><i>But where was this enviable mountaineering adventure taking place?</i></p>
            <p><i>What is the name of the mountain on which Foeke was standing?</i></p>

            <h3>Information on stickers</h3>
            <p>Stickers can provide important clues for geolocation. The design, branding, and even wear and tear on a sticker can hint at its age and origin.</p>
            <p>Analyzing the Bellingcat sticker in this image, we might be able to narrow down where it was placed and whether similar stickers have been used elsewhere.</p>

            <h3>Geographic features</h3>
            <p>Mountains have unique geological formations, which can be used to identify their location. The ridgelines, peaks, and nearby valleys can serve as a "fingerprint" for a specific location.</p>
            <p>By comparing these features to known mountain ranges, we can narrow down potential locations.</p>

            <h3>Google Image search</h3>
            <p>Google Reverse Image Search is a useful tool for matching similar photos online. By uploading or linking the image, we can find other instances of this view.</p>
            <p>With some luck, we may find images of this exact location, potentially with details confirming the mountain's name.</p>
